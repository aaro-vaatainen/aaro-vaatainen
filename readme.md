## Profile

I build and maintain independent hybrid lab and cloud environments, combining on-prem virtualization with hosted infrastructure.

This is personal, hands-on infrastructure work — focused on understanding architecture, service separation, and deployment structure rather than operating enterprise production systems.

Primary focus:
- Proxmox VE (VM & LXC)
- Cloud-hosted instances
- Networking fundamentals and service routing
- Containerized workloads
- Structured service environments

---

## Core Stack

**Virtualization & On-Prem**
- Proxmox VE (VM / LXC management)
- Resource allocation and lifecycle control
- Linux-based systems (Debian / Ubuntu)

**Cloud Environment**
- Virtual private servers
- Public-facing service hosting
- Secure remote access architecture
- Distributed service placement

**Networking**
- Service segmentation
- Reverse proxy routing
- Private ↔ public service exposure design
- Controlled port and traffic structure

**Containerization**
- Docker / Docker Compose
- Multi-service deployments
- Structured stack configuration

**Self-Hosted Services**
- Lightweight web services
- Internal tools
- Containerized applications
- Controlled external endpoints

### Hybrid Deployments
- Proxmox-hosted virtual environments connected to cloud infrastructure
- Service segmentation between on-prem and cloud
- Reverse proxy routing across distributed services

### Service Architecture
- Modular Docker stacks
- Reproducible environment setup
- Structured configuration hierarchy
